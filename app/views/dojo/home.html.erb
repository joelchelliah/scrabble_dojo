					<h4>Welcome</h4>
					<p>
						This website is a hobby project that I've been working on since August 2013. It contains a collection of tools and resources for improving your Scrabble skills.

								You need to

					</p>
					<p>
						All tools that require a dictionary look-up currently only have access to the Norwegian dictionary (NSF-ordliste). Support for other languages may be available in the future.

					<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
					<p>
						The use of these tools are purely meant for the purpose of improving your skills. They should not be used to cheat in Scrabble or other word-based games.
